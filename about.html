                        <p>An engineer-turned-lawyer Wazir Singh Poonia has broad and extensive experience in various walks of life. He graduated as a Textile Engineer(B.Text) from T.I.T, Bhiwani
                            (Haryana) in 1980. After having a successful career as an engineer he ventured into textile business, after doing his P.G.D.B.A from Annamalai University. He always had a 
                            keen interest in the socio-political developments of the day which inspired him to learn the law of the land. In his pursuit of excellence he did his masters in law (LL.M)
                            from Kurukshetra University. He is currently practicing law in District court, Hisar.
                        </p>
                        <p>He founded Brihati Reforms Foundation with the objective of establishing an egalitarian society. Throughout his life he witnessed how caste has played major factor
                            in socio-political setup of the society. He was inspired by Dr B R Ambedkar life and his seminal work  Annihilation of Caste. He dedicated few years initially to understand
                            how caste plays out in various segments of society. He also theorised how we can actually build a casteless society. The result of all this was a book he published in 2021 by the name
                            "Casteless India". Following the success of this, he started interacting with various leaders of society to carry forward his message to the people to effect real change on ground.
                            This is where the idea to build a dedicated organization for the cause came up in the form of Brihati Reforms Foundation.

                            The idea to work in the field as socially important as caste abolition resonanted with her and she also decided to work and contribute actively as part of the foundation.
